# Stack

## Concept

* LIFO( last in first out)

* Data -Primitive and Complex(structure, list, multimedia)

* Operation (insert(push), delete(pop), check stack empty or full)

  Push- push to the top

  Pop- remove from top, store popped value, return true if pop was successful. 

  in fact, popped item remaining, we can think just cursor is moved 

* Stack in C is 1-dimensional array(top= -1)
